# AfroPhyto

AfroPhyto is an open-access database of bioactive phytochemicals from African plants.  
It provides a curated collection of phytochemical data from peer-reviewed literature, allowing researchers to explore, compare, and contribute new data globally.  

The project aims to centralize African plant phytochemical data and facilitate natural product research, drug discovery, and interoperability with global bioinformatics resources.
